Session vs cookies

The concept is storing persistent data across page loads for a web visitor.
 Cookies store it directly on the client. Sessions use a cookie stored on the server side.

It is preferred to use sessions because the actual values are hidden from the client,
and you control when the data expires and becomes invalid. If it was all based on cookies,
a user (or hacker) could manipulate their cookie data and then play requests to your site.
