Difference between Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

vertical scaling means that when a lot of request come you just increase machine size.
Horizontal scaling means that when a lot of request come you just increase number of machine.

key difference between Vertical and Horizontal scaling

Horizental 
1/Load balancing request
2/RESILIENT(if one machine fail request forward to another one)
3/ communication throw network(which is slow).
4/Data inconsistance
5/scale well when your user increase(cause you can easily add another machine)

vertical
1/N/A
2/single point failure.
3/Inter process communication(which is fast cause same machine).
4/ Data consistance
5/Hadware limitation(you can't add big and bigger machine)
