4/You are implementing a REST API. What are the differences between PUT and POST?
POST sends data
to a particular URI
and expects the
resource at that
URI to deal with
the request. The
web server at this
point can decide
what to do with the
data in the context
of the specified
resource
A
PUT puts a file or
resource at a
particular URI and
exactly at that URI.
If there is already a
file or resource at
that URI, PUT
changes that file or
resource. If there
is no resource or
file there, PUT
creates one
B
PUT is idempotent,
meaning, invoking
it any number of
times will not have
any impact on
resources
C
POST is not
idempotent D
All of the above E

2/Degree of an Array
The weight of an array is defined as the maximum number of occurrences of any integer in the array. Given an array of positive integers `k`, find the smallest possible length of a subarray of the array `k` that
has the same weight as `k`. Integers should remain contiguous in the subarray.
Example 1:
Input: k = [1,2,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: k = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Constraints:
• k.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
• k[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.


3/Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
After rotating 1 steps to the right, array becomes: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
After rotating 2 steps to the right, array becomes: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
After rotating 3 steps to the right, array becomes: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
After rotating 1 steps to the right, array becomes: [99,-1,-100,3]
After rotating 2 steps to the right, array becomes: [3,99,-1,-100]
