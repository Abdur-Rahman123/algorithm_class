call vs apply vs bind

function myfun(c,d){
    console.log(this);
    console.log(this.a+this.b+c+d);
}
//one function share different object that time call,bind and apply will use.
//difference between call and apply: when argument pass call will pass argument by seperating "," and apply will call by array type[] .
// myfun.call({a:40,b:60},1,2);
// myfun.apply({a:100,b:200},[2,3]);
//bind will call when you have to bind something don't have to call now.this time you have to call bind.
let test=myfun.bind({a:10,b:30},40,50);
test();
//myfun();
