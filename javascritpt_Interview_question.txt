call vs apply vs bind

function myfun(c,d){
    console.log(this);
    console.log(this.a+this.b+c+d);
}
//one function share different object that time call,bind and apply will use.
//difference between call and apply: when argument pass call will pass argument by seperating "," and apply will call by array type[] .
// myfun.call({a:40,b:60},1,2);
// myfun.apply({a:100,b:200},[2,3]);
//bind will call when you have to bind something don't have to call now.this time you have to call bind.
let test=myfun.bind({a:10,b:30},40,50);
test();
//myfun();


///Explain this in javascript
Here are the different ways in which this can be used:

Global context: When this is used outside of any function or object, it refers to the global object. 
In a browser environment, the global object is window.

Function context: When this is used inside a function, its value is determined by how the function is called. 
If the function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object. 
If the function is called without an explicit context, 
this refers to the global object.

Method context: When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to the object itself.

Constructor context: When a function is used as a constructor with the new keyword, 
this refers to the newly created object.

Event context: When a function is used as an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event.

// Global context
console.log(this); // Output: Window

function myFunction() {
  // Function context
  console.log(this); // Output: Window
}

const myObject = {
  myMethod() {
    // Method context
    console.log(this); // Output: myObject
  }
};

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const john = new Person('John', 30);
console.log(john); // Output: Person { name: 'John', age: 30 }

In the example above, Person is a constructor function that takes in two arguments, 
name and age. When we create a new object john using the new keyword and pass in the arguments 'John' and 30, this inside 
the constructor function refers to the newly created john object.

const myElement = document.getElementById('myElement');
myElement.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Event context
  console.log(this); // Output: myElement
});


///async vs await vs promise
In JavaScript, Promises are objects representing an intermediate state of operation which is guaranteed to complete its execution at some point in the future. Async/await is a syntactic sugar for Promises, a wrapper making the code execute more synchronously. Async functions always return a Promise, even if the operation they are performing is synchronous. This means that you can always use .then() and .catch() methods on the return value of an async function, even if you are not using Promises explicitly12.
Promise has 3 states – resolved, rejected and pending. Async/await does not have states. Async functions return a promise. This promise state can be either resolved or rejected. Await suspends the called function execution until the promise returns a result for that execution. If there are other functions been called after await, these executions wait until the promise finishes1.

In summary, async/await is built on top of Promises and provides a cleaner syntax for working with Promises in JavaScript2.

Here’s an example of how to use Promises in JavaScript:

function fetchUsers() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve([{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 30 }]);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchUsers()
  .then(users => console.log(users))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
  
  Here’s an example of how to use async/await syntax in JavaScript:

async function fetchUsers() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
    const users = await response.json();
    console.log(users);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

fetchUsers();
